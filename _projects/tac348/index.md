Aerospace Structural Analysis and ANSYS Simulation Project
description: This semester-long project in AME 485 involved comprehensive finite element analysis (FEA) of aerospace and mechanical components using ANSYS. I built detailed geometries and developed models with both solid and shell elements, carefully generating meshes for each and selecting appropriate element types, mesh densities, and solver settings to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. I also created custom material definitions to represent advanced aerospace materials accurately.
Through static structural, thermal, and modal analyses, I evaluated stress, strain, deformation, thermal gradients, and natural frequencies under multiple boundary conditions. Critical regions were identified, and failure modes, safety margins, and design risks—including yield, buckling, and fatigue sensitivity—were assessed, enabling both informed design recommendations and identification of potential points of failure for improved component reliability.
